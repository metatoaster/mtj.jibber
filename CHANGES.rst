Changelog
=========

0.4 - 2015-09-12
----------------

- Fully require the ``bot`` argument for all methods.
- Support hooking up handlers to lower level events, making it possible
  to hook that up via the config file to available module/class paths.
  This is implemented in the ``presence`` module.
- For the mean time ``Presence`` is the new base ``Handler`` for the
  lower level events.
- First such handler is the automatic rejoin when bot is no longer in
  a channel, implemented in the ``Muc`` class.
- Another one is greeter, implemented in the ``MucGreeter`` class.
- The ``Command`` class is now a subclass of ``Handler``; that is now
  the class that will be checked.  In the future this requirement may
  be dropped once validation of argument signature for the provided
  callables can be done.
- A ``LastActivity`` feature; can be used as a ``!seen`` trigger to
  get back a rough idea on when the user was last seen.  This intends to
  be a demo implementation.
- Test client class now supports scheduling properly; clear method now
  works as intended.
- Other minor cleanup and updated tests.

0.3 - 2014-10-08
----------------

- ``MucChatBot.send_message`` now much more resistant to malformed
  messages generated by package method, and now allow overriding of both
  ``mbody`` and ``mhtml`` arguments which will cascade down to the real
  ``send_message`` method, if bot authors want complete output control.
- Consistently handle lists that may be generated by package_methods in
  the same way as a single text or dict.
- No longer will assign a reference to ``bot`` for every instances of
  ``Command`` class.

0.2 - 2014-02-27
----------------

- Private chat message handling for private message commands.
- Core configuration file generation from the jibber shell command.
- Helper method for dynamic module reloading within debug mode.


0.1 - 2013-11-14
----------------

- Core functions implemented, including connect to XMPP server as a muc
  client, and to provide trigger handlers and dynamic module/object
  loaders so those triggers can make something happen.
