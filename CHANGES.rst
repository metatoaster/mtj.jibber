Changelog
=========

0.4 - Unreleased
----------------

- Fully require the ``bot`` argument for all methods.
- Support hooking up handlers to lower level events, making it possible
  to hook that up via the config file to available module/class paths.
- First such handler is the automatic rejoin on channel kick.
- The ``Command`` class is now a sublcass of ``Handler``; that is now
  the class that will be checked.  In the future we will drop this
  requirement once validation of argument signature for the provided
  callables can be done.
- Test client class now supports scheduling properly; clear method now
  works as intended.
- Other minor cleanup and updated tests.

0.3 - 2014-10-08
----------------

- ``MucChatBot.send_message`` now much more resistant to malformed
  messages generated by package method, and now allow overriding of both
  ``mbody`` and ``mhtml`` arguments which will cascade down to the real
  ``send_message`` method, if bot authors want complete output control.
- Consistently handle lists that may be generated by package_methods in
  the same way as a single text or dict.
- No longer will assign a reference to ``bot`` for every instances of
  ``Command`` class.

0.2 - 2014-02-27
----------------

- Private chat message handling for private message commands.
- Core configuration file generation from the jibber shell command.
- Helper method for dynamic module reloading within debug mode.


0.1 - 2013-11-14
----------------

- Core functions implemented, including connect to XMPP server as a muc
  client, and to provide trigger handlers and dynamic module/object
  loaders so those triggers can make something happen.
